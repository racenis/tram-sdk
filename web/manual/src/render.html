	Render system
</h1>

<p>
	The rendering system handles the 3D and 2D rendering.
</p>

<p>
	In the source code it is found under the <code>Core::Render</code> namespace. Definitions are in the <code>render.h</code> file.
</p>

	<p>
		Currently the system is implemented as a simple wrapper around OpenGL, but this will probably change in the future. That means that the API will change too.
