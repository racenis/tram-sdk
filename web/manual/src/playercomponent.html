	PlayerComponent
</h1>

<p>
	A PlayerComponent holds the implementation of player-specific code of the <a href="player.html">Player entity</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The component lets the player control the player entity with input devices. It also interacts with the <a href="worldcell.html">level streaming system</a>.
</p>

<p>
	You can add a PhysicsComponent to an <a href="entity.html">Entity</a> to have it interact with the rest of the physics world. Check the implementation of <a href="staticworldobject.html">StaticWorldObject</a> and <a href="crate.html">Crate</a> for details.
