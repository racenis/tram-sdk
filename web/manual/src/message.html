	Message

<p>
	A message is a basic method of communication between entities and other entities or engine systems. For example, when a player 'activates' an entity (such as by looking at it and pressing an activation key), the entity that the player is looking at is sent an 'activation' message. Each entity type then implements the behavior for an 'activation' in their message handler (if any).
