<h1>
	Entity
</h1>

<p>
	An entity in the engine is a thing with a location, a rotation and some attached EntityComponents. Entities usually are attached to a WorldCell (consider to be inside a one).
</p>
<p>
	Each entity type also should have a SerializedEntityData data structure. It should contain the information to construct the entity's components. When an entity is loaded (added to the world).
</p>


<h2>
	Serialization States
</h2>

<p>
	Entities can exist in 3 different states. The first is the serialized string, which is how entities are stored on the hard disk and in save files. The string consists of two parts -- shared part and type-specific part. The shared part contains the entity type, optional ID number, optional name, location, rotation and action. The type-specific part depends on the entity type.
</p>
<p>
	The second state is the serialized-in-memory state. In this state, the entity's type-specific data is stored in a SerializedEntityData structure, which is a compact binary representation of the serialized string (it's parsed from the string).
</p>
<p>
	The third state is the loaded state, in which the data contained inside the SerializedEntityData structured is used to construct the entity's components.
