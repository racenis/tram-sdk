# Libraries

This directory contains all of the dependencies of the framework part of the SDK.

The header files for the various libraries used in the framework are provided here, for convenience, as well as binaries for 64-bit windows, since compiling all of the libraries from source would take about an hour.

Some of these libraries are not covered under the MIT license, so check before modifying them.
