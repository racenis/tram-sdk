	Particle Component
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	This <a href="../framework/entitycomponent.html">EntityComponent</a> allows
	the creation of a particle system.
</p>

<p>
	The API is still not finallized. It's possible to manually spawn in
	individual particles, but this feature is still being worked on.
</p>

	If you have any suggestions, consider
