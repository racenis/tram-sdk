	Controller Component
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	This <a href="../framework/entitycomponent.html">EntityComponent</a> can be
	used for controlling players and NPCs and that sort of stuff.
</p>

<h2>Programming in C++</h2>

<p>
	<code>#<span class="codekeyw">include</span> &lt;<span class="codelit">components/controller.h</span>&gt;</code> <br/>
	<a href="../../cppapi/classtram_1_1_controller_component.html">API documentation
	page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	All you really need to do to get started is just the creation of the 
	component. Also you need to feed in a pointer to the entity which will be
	controlled by this component. It will automatically update the position of
	it when it moves.
</p>

<code>
	<span class="codefunc">Component</span>&lt;<span class="codefunc">ControllerComponent</span>&gt; component;<br/>
	<br/>
	component.<span class="codefunc">make</span>();<br/>
	component-&gt;<span class="codefunc">SetParent</span>(<span class="codekeyw">this</span>);<br/>
	component-&gt;<span class="codefunc">Init</span>();
</code>

<p>
	After that, you can begin sending commands to the component. Check the
	<a href="../../cppapi/classtram_1_1_controller_component.html">API 
	documentation</a> to see what kinds of commands there are. You can also
	look at the implementation of the <a href="player.html">PlayerComponent</a>
	to see an example of the usage of the component.
