	Render Component
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	This <a href="../framework/entitycomponent.html">EntityComponent</a> is a
	wrapper around a <a href="../render.html#drawlistentry"> draw list entry</a>.
	It provides an easy to use interface by which it is possible to add a 3D
	model to the scene and to manipulate it in various ways.
</p>

<p>
	This is the first component I created for the framework and the one I have
	been cooking for the longest. Hopefully it is also very good and very
	useful. If you do not find it very useful, leave a
	<a href="https://github.com/racenis/tram-sdk/issues">Github issue</a>.
