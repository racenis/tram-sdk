<h1>
	Animation Component
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	This <a href="../framework/entitycomponent.html">EntityComponent</a> plays
	back <a href="../render/animation.html">animations</a>. More precisely, it
	generates pose matrices for the deformation of 3D models. It basically lets
	you animate 3D models.
</p>

<p>
	With this component you get 8 tracks to play back animations on. You also
	get an additional track for procedural animations.
</p>

<p>
	Multiple animations get added together. This can be used to animate
	parts of characters seperately.
</p>

<p>
	The playback speed of animations can be changed. This is useful for movement
	animations.
</p>

<p>
	You can also set up weights for animations. For example, you could create a
	nodding animation for a character. Then you could play it back with a weight
	of 0.2 to get a slight nod, 0.5 to get a normal nod and 1.0 to get a very 
	enthusiastic nod.
</p>

<p>
	There are also fade-ins and fade-outs, which gradually increase or decrease
	the animation weight. This could be used, for example, if you created a 
	walking animation for a character, which you could fade out, to make the 
	character appear as if it is gradually coming to a stop.
</p>


<p>
	There is some limited animation re-targeting &ndash; if the model for which
	you created the animations has an armature which is similar enough for the
	model which you want to animate, you can play back the same animations ande
	everything will work. The bone names do need to be exactly the same in both
	models.
</p>

<h2>Programming in C++</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	<code>#<span class="codekeyw">include</span> &lt;<span class="codelit">components/animation.h</span>&gt;</code> <br/>
	<a href="../../cppapi/classtram_1_1_animation_component.html">API documentation
	page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that you need to do before initializing this component? You
	need to feed it a model. This has to be a 
	<a href="../render/model.html#dynamic">dynamic model</a>, since 
	<a href="../render/model.html#static">static models</a> have no 
	<a href="../render.html#armature">bone</a> data in them.
</p>

<code>
	Component&lt;AnimationComponent&gt; component;<br/>
	<br/>
	component.make();<br/>
	component->SetModel("mongus");<br/>
	component->Init();
</code>

<p>
	Then you can begin playing some animations. You do need to make sure that 
	the animation that you want to play is already loaded, since I forgot to
	add the code for them to be automatically streamed in. Anyway:
</p>

<code class="codeexample">Animation::Find("mongus-run")->Load();
	
component->PlayAnimation("mongus-run",
                         -1,
                         1.0f,
                         1.0f);
</code>

<p>
	If you look closely, you will notice that we set the number of repeats to
	-1. This means that it will repeat for a very long time. It will stop 
	eventually, but it will take at least 2 years for an application running
	at 60 FPS.
</p>

<p>
	To actually view the animation that you are playing, you need to attach it
	to a <a href="render.html">RenderComponent</a>.
</p>

<code>
	Component&lt;RenderComponent&gt; model;<br/>
	<br/>
	model.make();<br/>
	model->SetModel("mongus");<br/>
	model->Init();<br/>
	<br/>
	model->SetArmature(component);
</code>

<p>
	The possibilities of animation playback are limitless. Check the
	<a href="../../cppapi/classtram_1_1_animation_component.html">API
	documentation</a> for more information.

	Still working on this.
