<p>
	UID is also aliased as name_t and called a name. It is my greatest
	technological accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
	When a name is created, the string representation of it is saved into a very
	nice string table. The name itself only the index of the string in the 
	string table.
</p>

<p>
	The system also ensures that each string gets store only once. This means
	that name instances with identical string representations also have the same
	inded. This makes the comparisons between names very fast and efficient.
</p>

<p>
	Also I have no idea what UID actually stands for, I forgot it a very long
	time ago.
