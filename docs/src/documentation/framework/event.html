<h1>
	Events
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	Events are the main form of decoupled data interchange in the framework.
	People with too much time will recognize it as the &laquo;Observer&raquo;
	design pattern.
</p>

<p>
	The main emitter of events is the <a href="ui.html">UI system</a>, which
	emits an event for every keypress and every mousemove.
</p>

<p>
	There's also the tick and frame events, which are emitted by the 
	<a href="core.html">Core system</a> for each tick and frame respectively.
</p>

<h2>
	Key concepts
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	Event
</h4>

<p>
	It is like a thing that has happened. Each event has a type, a subtype and
	it contains information about its emitter and has some optional data that
	can be attached to the event.
</p>

<h4>
	Listener
</h4>

<p>
	It allows the event system to keep track of all of the other systems,
	entities and components that are interested in an event.
</p>

<p>
	After a registrant has registered an event listener for a specific event
	type, the event system will begin dispatching events of said type either to
	a callback function or to an event handler method of the registrant.
</p>

<h2>
	Event types
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	In order to use an event, you need to know what that event is and what it
	does. What it means. What does it mean?
</p>

<p>
	These are the events which I have created, which means that I can tell you
	what they do. If you use someone else's events. you need to ask them what
	they do. If you have created the events yourself, you will need to ask
	yourself what you meant by them. This might be difficult, even the greatest
	philosophers have struggled to understand themselves.
</p>

<h4>
	Keypress | <code>KEYPRESS</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Emitted every frame that a key is being held down. The subtype field of the
	event contains a <a href="ui.html">UI::KeyboardKey</a> enumeration number,
	depending on which key was pressed.
</p>

<h4>
	Keydown | <code>KEYDOWN</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Same as keypress, except that the event is emitted only on the frame on
	which the key was pressed down for the first time.
</p>

<h4>
	Keyup | <code>KEYUP</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Same as keypress, except that the event is emitted only when the key is
	released.
</p>

<h4>
	Keychar | <code>KEYCHAR</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Used for text input. Emitted whenever a keyboard key used for text input is 
	pressed. The subtype field contains a UTF-16 encoded codepoint of the text
	character.
</p>

<h4>
	Cursorpos | <code>CURSORPOS</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Emitted whenever the mouse cursor pointer position changes. No data.
</p>

<h4>
	Frame | <code>FRAME</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Emitted every frame. It's very useful when you want to execute some code
	every frame &ndash; simply register a listener with a callback function
	containing your code.
</p>
	
<h4>
	Tick | <code>TICK</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Very similar to the frame event, the main difference being that this event
	is independent of them frame rate &ndash; every second exactly 60 tick
	events will be emitted.
</p>


<h4>
	Selected | <code>SELECTED</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Emitted by entities which are selected. Data pointer points to a 
	<a href="value.html">Value</a> which contains a name, which represents the
	type of the entity. This event can be used for displaying information
	about the selected entity, i.e. actions which can be performed on the
	entity.
</p>

<h4>
	Look at | <code>LOOK-AT</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Emitted by entities which are looking at something. Data pointer points to
	a <a href="value.html">Value</a> which contains a quaternion with the look
	direction of the entity.
</p>


<h4>
	Last event | <code>LAST_EVENT</code>
</h4>

<p>
	This is not actually an event.
</p>

<h2>
	Programming in C++
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	<code>#<span class="codekeyw">include</span> &lt;<span class="codelit">framework/event.h</span>&gt;</code> <br/>
	<a href="../../cppapi/structtram_1_1_event.html">API documentation
	page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Let's emit our own event!
</p>

<code>
	<span class="codekeyw">const name_t</span> m_type = <span class="codelit">"mongus"</span>;<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codeclass">Event</span> event;<br/>
	<br/>
	event.type = <span class="codeclass">Event</span>::SELECTED;<br/>
    event.subtype = <span class="codelit">420</span>;<br/>
    event.poster_id = <span class="codeclass">Entity</span>::<span class="codefunc">Find</span>(<span class="codelit">"mongus"</span>)-><span class="codefunc">GetID</span>();<br/>
    <br/>
	event.data = <span class="codeclass">Event</span>::<span class="codefunc">AllocateData</span>&lt;<span class="codeclass">Value</span>&gt;(m_type);<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codeclass">Event</span>::<span class="codefunc">Post</span>(event);
</code>

<p>
	The <code>Event::AllocateData()</code> static method allocates a bit of memory for use with the
	event data pointer. This allocated memory gets automatically released when
	all of the emitted events have been dispatched.
</p>

<p>
	There are the <code>Event::AddListener()</code> and the
	<code>Event::RemoveListener()</code> static methods to add and remove event
	listeners respectively, but there is also a smart pointer type which will
	automatically remove the listener when deleted.
</p>

<code>
	<span class="codeclass">EventListener</span> keypress;<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codecomm">// creates an event listener</span><br/>
	keypress.<span class="codefunc">make</span>(<span class="codeclass">Event</span>::KEYPRESS, <span class="codekeyw">this</span>);<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codecomm">// removes an event listener</span><br/>
	keypress.<span class="codefunc">clear</span>();
</code>

<p>
	If you want to, you can also create new event types.
</p>

<code>
	<span class="codekeyw">event_t</span> frog_event = <span class="codeclass">Event</span>::<span class="codefunc">Register</span>(<span class="codelit">"frog-event"</span>);
</code>

<h2>
	Scripting in Lua
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Emitting an event is very similar to how it is done with the C++ API. The
	main difference is that we can't attach arbitrary data to the event, instead
	we are limited to floating point numbers, integers and names, which is the
	same limitation as with <a href="signal.html">Signals</a>.
</p>

<code>
	event = {}<br/>
	event.type = tram.event.<span class="codefunc">GetType</span>(<span class="codelit">"my_fancy_event"</span>)<br/>
	event.subtype = <span class="codelit">420</span><br/>
	event.poster = tram.entity.<span class="codefunc">Find</span>(mongus):<span class="codefunc">GetID</span>()<br/>
	event.data = <span class="codelit">"mongus"</span><br/>
	<br/>
	tram.event.<span class="codefunc">Post</span>(event)
</code>

<p>
	Registering events and adding event listeners is also similar.
</p>

<code>
	<span class="codekeyw">local</span> frog_event = tram.event.<span class="codefunc">Register</span>(<span class="codelit">"frog-event"</span>)<br/>
	<br/>
	tram.event.<span class="codefunc">AddListener</span>(frog_event, <span class="codekeyw">function</span>(event)<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type_name = tram.event.<span class="codefunc">GetName</span>(event.type)<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subtype = event.subtype<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poster = tram.entity.<span class="codefunc">Find</span>(event.poster)<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data = event.data<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="codefunc">print</span>(<span class="codelit">"Event received:"</span>,<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type_name,<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subtype,<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poster:<span class="codefunc">GetName</span>(),<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data)<br/>
	<span class="codekeyw">end</span>)<br/>
</code>
