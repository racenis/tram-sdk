<h1>
	Core
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	This is the main system of the framework. It keeps track of the main loop,
	provides ID number generation services and keeps track of the framework
	version.
</p>

<h2>
	Key concepts
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	Frame
</h4>

<p>
	Each cycle of the main loop is called a frame. It is called that because
	during each loop you render a single frame of graphics.
</p>

<h4>
	Tick
</h4>

<p>
	There are 60 ticks in a second. If you have a 60hz monitor and you have
	turned on vsync or a frame limiter,	then a tick will be the same as a frame.
</p>

<p>
	This concept allows you to create applications as if they were always run
	at 60 frames per second.
</p>

<h2>
	Programming in C++

</p>

<p>
	Every application created with the framework needs to initialize and update
	the core system.
</p>

<code>
	<span class="codeclass">Core</span>::<span class="codefunc">Init</span>();<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codecomm">// main loop</span><br/>
	<span class="codekeyw">while</span> (<span class="codekeyw">true</span>) {<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="codeclass">Core</span>::<span class="codefunc">Update</span>();<br/>
	}<br/>
	<br/>
</code>


<p>
	That was very simple.
</p>

<code>
	<span class="codekeyw">id_t</span> id = <span class="codefunc">GenerateID</span>();<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codekeyw">uint32_t</span> ticks = <span class="codefunc">GetTick</span>();<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codekeyw">double</span> time = <span class="codefunc">GetTickTime</span>();<br/>
	<span class="codekeyw">float</span> delta_time <span class="codefunc">GetDeltaTime</span>();<br/>
</code>

<p>
	After the previous bit of code is executed:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		The variable <i>id</i> will contain a new, unique ID number.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The variable <i>ticks</i> will contain the number of ticks which have 
		elapsed since the initialization of the application.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The variable <i>time</i> will contain the time, in seconds, that has
		passed since the initialization of the application.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The variable <i>delta_time</i> will contain the time, in seconds, that
		has passed between the start of this and the start of the previous
		frame.
	</li>
</ul>
