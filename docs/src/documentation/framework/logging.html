<h1>
	Logging
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	The logging system provides logging.
</p>

<p>
	Currently all logs are just dumped to standard output. In the future I'll 
	add in some more logging stuff, like saving logs to a file.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to assign the system from which the logging statement
	originates, as well as the logging statements severity. Logs then can be
	filtered based on the system and severity.
</p>

<h2>
	Severities
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	Info | SEVERITY_INFO
</h4>

<p>
	For very verbose debugging purposes. Useful to dump anything and everything.
	Filtered out by default.
</p>

<h4>
	Warning | SEVERITY_WARNING
</h4>

<p>
	For things that should be looked at, such as the use of deprecated
	functionality, missing files and such.
</p>

<h4>
	Error | SEVERITY_ERROR
</h4>

<p>
	For things that are ungood, but can be recovered from, such as errors with
	file formatting, incorrect usage of functionality and such.
</p>

<h4>
	Doubleplus Ungood Error | SEVERITY_CRITICAL_ERROR
</h4>

<p>
	For errors that can't be recovered from. Useful to log some final data
	before aborting the application.
</p>
