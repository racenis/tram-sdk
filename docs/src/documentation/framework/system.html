<h1>
	Systems
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	The system concept was created to help identify parts of code.
</p>

<p>
	This allows, for example, to check if a system has been initialized. This is
	useful for systems which have a dependency on another system &ndash; they
	can check if the system that they have a dependecy on has been initialized
	before initializing themselves.
</p>

<p>
	This concept also allows tracking <a href="stats.html">statistics</a> and
	filtering <a href="logging.h">logging</a> based on the system from which the
	logs originate.
</p>

<p>
	Some systems are already registered into the framework, but you can register
	your own systems too.
