<h1>
	Type
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	There are a couple of types, which the framework supports for 
	<a href="value.html">values</a>, <a href="signal.html">signals</a> and
	<a href="script.html">scripting API</a>.
</p>

<h2>
	Main types
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	All of these types are supported by signals, scripting API and level editor.
</p>

<h4>
	Int
</h4>

<p>
	Same as Int32.
</p>

<h4>
	Float
</h4>

<p>
	Same as Float32.
</p>

<h4>
	Name
</h4>

<p>
	Alias for <a href="uid.html">UID</a>.
</p>

<h2>
	All types
