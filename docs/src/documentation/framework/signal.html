<h1>
	Signals
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	Signals are <a href="message.html">Message</a> presets that can be attached
	to entities.
</p>	

<p>
	These can be configured in the <a href="../level-editor.html">level
	editor</a>, or they	can be attached through scripting.	
</p>

<p>
	When the appropriate moment comes, the entity will fire off the signal,
	which in turn will send off the preset message.
</p>

<p>
	Signals are named so as to be confusing to Godot users. Similar frameworks
	call these the entity input/output system.
</p>

<h2>
	Key concepts
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	Signal type
</h4>

<p>
	Each signal has a type. This type determines what kind of action cause the
	signal to fire.
</p>

<p>
	Any entity can fire off any signal type for any action, but to keep it
	consistent we have described some signal types.
</p>

<h4>
	Signal firing
</h4>

<p>
	When the appropriate moment comes, the entity fires off the signal. This
	causes the signal table to look up all message presets associated with the
	fired signal type. The signal table will then send off all of the relevant
	message presets.
</p>

<p>
	While signal message presets can have a value attached to them to be sent as
	the attached data, during firing the entity can choose to replace the data
	with something other than what the preset contains.
</p>

<h4>
	Signal table
</h4>

<p>
	Contains all of the signals that are defined for a certain entity. Can be
	edited in the level editor. On disk each entity's signals are stored in the
	<a href="worldcell.html">Worldcell</a> file.
</p>

<h2>
	Signal types
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	None | <code>NONE</code>
</h4>

<p>
	This is not a signal.
</p>

<h4>
	Spawn | <code>SPAWN</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when an entity is loaded.
</p>

<h4>
	Kill | <code>KILL</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when an entity is killed.
</p>

<h4>
	Activate | <code>ACTIVATE</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired off when an entity is activated. What is considered an activation 
	depends on the entity type.
</p>

<h4>
	Use | <code>USE</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when the entity is activated, that is, receives a <i>Activate Once</i>
	message.
</p>

<h4>
	Locked Use | <code>LOCKED_USE</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Same as Use, but fired when entity activation fails due to the entity being
	locked.
</p>

<h4>
	Open | <code>OPEN</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when the entity begins opening.
</p>

<h4>
	Close | <code>CLOSE</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when the entity begins closing.
</p>

<h4>
	End Open | <code>END_OPEN</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when the entity finishes opening.
</p>

<h4>
	End Close | <code>END_CLOSE</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when the entity finishes closing.
</p>

<h4>
	Trigger | <code>TRIGGER</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when the entity is triggered.
</p>

<h4>
	Enter Trigger | <code>ENTER_TRIGGER</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when an entity enters a trigger. Its ID is attached as data in the
	message.
</p>

<h4>
	Exit Trigger | <code>EXIT_TRIGGER</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired when an entity exits a trigger. Its ID is attached as data in the
	message.
</p>

<h4>
	Progress | <code>PROGRESS</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Fired every tick that an entity is progressing. It replaces the message data
	with a floating point progress value.
</p>

<p>
	If the message type attached to this signal is set to Set Progress, then it
	is possible to synchronize two entities that support progress.
</p>

<h4>
	Last Signal | <code>LAST_SIGNAL</code>
</h4>

<p>
	Not actually a signal.
</p>
