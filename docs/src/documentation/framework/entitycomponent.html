<h1>
	EntityComponent
</h1>

<p>
	EntityComponents are re-usable parts for assembling <a href="entity.html">
	Entities</a>. Need to display a 3D model for an entity? Use a
	RenderComponent. Need to add entity to the physics simulation? Use a
	PhysicsComponent. Have an entity that simulates a frog and want to add frog
	behavior to other entities? Refactor the frog code into a FrogComponent.
</p>

<p>
	Most components are created in a way that you can use them without attaching
	them to an entity, so you can use a RenderComponent to render some
	UI elements, or a skybox or something like that, but in general they are
	used for constructing entities.
</p>

<p>
	Components can have dependencies on <a href="resource.html">Resources</a>.
	This can be automatically tracked.
</p>

<p>
	Unlike entities, which can be repeatedly loaded and unloaded, once a 
	component is initialized, it can only be deleted. After that it will have to
	be reconstructed and reinitialized.

<p>
	Components work something like this:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		The component class object is constructed.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The component is fed parameters by calling methods on it.
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If the parameter is a Resource and it is unloaded, then it gets
			added to the Async loader queue.
		</li>
		<li>
			In such a case, the component will remember that it is waiting
			for a resource.
		</li>
	</ul>
		
	<li>
		The component is initialized by calling the <code>Init()</code> method.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		If the component is waiting on any resources, then it will just do 
		nothing and will wait for them to be ready.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The component is started by either calling its own <code>Start()</code>
		method, if it isn't waiting on any resources, or by the
		<a href="asynv.html">Async</a> system, once the resources on which the
		component is waiting have been loaded.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The component does its component stuff. Some parameters may be changed
		by getting their methods called.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		The component class gets destructed.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	None of the constructors have any parameters &ndash; this is mostly due to
	the fact that I feel like the initialization code for components with a lot
	of parameters, and therefore very long constructors looks incredibly awful.
</p>
	
<p>
	If you want to create your own component, you can copy the header and
	implementation files of the 
	<a href="../components/template.html">TemplateComponent</a>.
</p>

<code>
	<span class="codeclass">Component</span>&lt;<span class="codeclass">TemplateComponent</span>&gt; template;<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codecomm">// constructs a new TemplateComponent</span><br/>
	template.<span class="codefunc">make(</span>);<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codecomm">// initializes it</span><br/>
	template-><span class="codefunc">Init</span>();<br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codecomm">// destructs it</span><br/>
	template.<span class="codefunc">clear</span>();<br/>
</code>

<p>
	The <code>Component</code> smart pointer class ensures that it will be
	constructed into the correct <a href = "../templates/pool.html">Pool</a>.
	This is required for some components to work properly, like the
	<a href="../components/animation.html">AnimationComponent</a>, which will
	not get updated if it isn't constructed in the correct pool.
