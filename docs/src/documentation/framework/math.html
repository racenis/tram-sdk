	Math

<hr/>

<p>
	This part of the framwork contains math stuff. Since we use the glm library,
	we don't really need to create any of our own math types, but I alisased
	the vector and matrix types into the <code>tram</code> namespace in order to
	increase the readability of the source code.
</p>

<p>
	There's also a couple of constants, which have to do with the coordinate
	system that we're using, i.e. <code>DIRECTION_FORWARD</code>,
	<code>DIRECTION_SIDE</code> and <code>DIRECTION_UP</code>.
</p>

<p>
	Other than that, this part of the framework contains a couple of random math
	functions which the glm library doesn't have. At least in C++ part of the
	framework.
</p>

<p>
	Since glm is a C++ only library, I re-implemented some of the vector types
	in Lua, so that they can be used for scripting.

	Creating a vector and operations on a vector
</p>

<code>
	vector = tram.math.<span class="codefunc">vec3</span>(<span class="codelit">420.0</span>, <span class="codelit">-42.0</span>, <span class="codelit">4.20</span>)<br/>
	<br/>
	vector = vector + tram.math.<span class="codefunc">vec3</span>(<span class="codelit">69.0</span>, <span class="codelit">-69.0</span>, <span class="codelit">6.9</span>)<br/>
	vector = vector + <span class="codelit">69.0</span><br/>
	<br/>
	<span class="codefunc">print</span>(<span class="codelit">"My vector:"</span>, vector)
</code>

<p>
	Creating a quaternion from euler angles and operations on it
</p>

<code>
	rotation = tram.math.<span class="codefunc">quat</span>(vector)<br/>
	<br/>
	rotation = rotation * rotation
</code>

<p>
	Rotating a vector by a quaternion
</p>

<code>
	vector = rotation * vector
</code>
