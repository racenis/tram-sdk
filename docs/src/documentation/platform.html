<h1>
	Platform
</h1>

<p>
	This system contains the platform compatibility layer. Basically it provides
	a single API to perform various tasks, which are platform-specific.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the creation of a window and the capture of keyboard keypress
	events is specific to the operating system. Windows uses the Win32 API and
	Linux uses the X Window System API. 
</p>

<p>
	To make porting easier, the framework does not use these APIs directly,
	instead using either the GLFW or the SDL libraries as a backend. It is also
	possible to create your own backend.
</p>

<p>
	Creating your own backend is useful if you want to embed the framework
	inside of another application. For example, the
	<a href="leveleditor.html">level editor</a> is a wxWidgets application that
	embeds the rendering system of the framework.
