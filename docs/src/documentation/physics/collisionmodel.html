<hr/>

<p>
	Collision models are essentially the 
	<a href="../framework/resource.html">Resource</a> form of the
	<a href="collisionshape.html">CollisionShape</a>. They consist of a
	single or several collision shapes.
</p>

<p>
	Collision models are stored in the <code>/data/model/</code> directory. The
	file extension is <code>.coll</code>. They can be created using the
	collision model exporter Blender plugin.
