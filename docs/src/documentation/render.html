<h1>
	Render
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	Probably one of the most useful systems in the framework. Performs all of
	the graphics stuff.
</p>

<h2>
	Key concepts
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	View
</h4>

<p>
	Virtual camera perspective. Can be set using a position vector and a
	rotation quaternion, or by directly feeding in a view and perspective
	matrices.
</p>

<h4>
	Layer
</h4>

<p>
	Objects can be assigned to a layer. Curently there are 7 layers. Objects
	in higher layers will be drawn on top of the objects in lower layers.
</p>

<h4>
	Graphics Primitive
</h4>

<p>
	A geometric shape that can be rasterized. The framework currently supports
	the rasterization of triangles and straight line segments.
</p>

<h4>
	Draw List Entry
</h4>

<p>
	A record in the draw list. The draw list is list of all of the objects,
	consisting of graphics primitives, that compose the rendered scene. To be
	eligble for being rendered to the screen, the object must be added to the
	draw list.
</p>

<h4>
	Vertex
</h4>

<p>
	A point consisting of some kind of a coordinate and possibly some other
	data. Used to construct graphics primitives. A triangle consists of 3
	vertices, a line segment of 2. Can be arranged in a buffer in list form.
</p>

<h4>
	Index
</h4>

<p>
	Reference to a vertex. Can be arranged in a buffer in list form. Invented as
	a digital computer memory saving measure sometime in the late 20th century.
</p>

<h4>
	Texture
</h4>

<p>
	Raster image that can be applied to the surface of a graphics primitive
	during rendering.
</p>

<h4>
	Material
</h4>

<p>
	Set of surface properties, possibly including a reference to a texture. 
	Determines how the surface of a graphics primitive will be rendered.
</p>

<h4>
	Light
</h4>

<p>
	If there was no light we could just clear the screen with a black color
	instead of rendering anything and you wouldn't even know.
</p>

<h4>
	Lightmap
</h4>

<p>
	Precomputed surface illumination for static objects. Allows the usage of
	some rather slow algorithms for lighting computations, i.e. ray tracing,
	path tracing, radiosity.
</p>

<h2>
	Backends
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	OpenGL
</h4>

<p>
	Written in a subset of OpenGL 4.0 and WebGL, this is the main rendering
	backend of the framework.
</p>

<h4>
	Direct3D
</h4>

<p>
	This backend uses the Direct3D9 fixed function pipeline. Not tested, but
	should work with Direct3D7 level hardware. Curently only supports static
	model, dynamic model and line rendering.
</p>

<h4>
	Software
</h4>

<p>
	This backend does all of the rendering on the CPU. Curently only supports
	static model, dynamic model and line rendering.
</p>

<h2>
	Lighting Types
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	Dynamic light
</h4>

<p>
	Can either be configured to act as a point light, or a spotlight.
</p>

<p>
	No real limit on the ammount of lights in the scene, but each object can be
	illuminated by only 4 lights at the same time.
</p>

<h4>
	Directional light
</h4>

<p>
	Light which is originating from a light source infinitely far away. Useful
	for modelling sunlight.
</p>

<p>
	The framework allows a single directional light to be used in the scene.
</p>

<h4>
	Ambient light
</h4>

<p>
	Adds some base lighting to every object in the scene. Has no direction.
</p>

<h4>
	Lightmap
</h4>

<p>
	Pre-computed lighting for a 3D model. Stored as a texture image. Only
	available to static models.
</p>

<h2>
	Programming in C++

</p>

<p>
	Initialization the same as with other systems.

<p>
	There's too many functions in the system to list, but here's some more
	useful ones.
