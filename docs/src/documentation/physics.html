	Physics

<hr/>

<p>
	The physics system provides rigidbody physics simulation services.
</p>

<p>
	Currently a single backed is implemented, which is the Bullet physics
	library backed, but more will be added in the future.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to add rigidbodies to your entities, consider using the
	<a href="components/physics.html">PhysicsComponent</a>. For triggers, the 
	<a href="components/trigger.html">TriggerComponent</a> is available.
</p>

<h2>
	Key concepts
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4 id="rigidbody">
	Rigidbody
</h4>

<p>
	An object in the physics simlation. Rigidbodies have some kind of a shape or
	volume. This is determined by their
	<a href="physics/collisionmodel.html">CollisionModel</a> or
	<a href="physics/collisionshape.html">CollisionShape</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="trigger">
	Trigger
</h4>

<p>
	Triggers are special shapes or volumes that can detect if a rigidbody enters
	its	volume.
</p>

<h4 id="collisiongroup">
	Collision Group
</h4>

<p>
	Collision groups are groups that the rigidbody, trigger or other physics
	construct is a part of. The object can be a part of several groups. They are
	represented by bits in a bitmask.
</p>

<p>
	It is more efficient for an object to belong to only a single group, or very
	few groups.
</p>

<h4 id="collisionmask">
	Collision Mask
</h4>

<p>
	Collision masks are groups with which the rigidbody, trigger or other
	physics	construct can collide with. The object can be set to collide with
	several groups. Allowed collision groups are represented by bits in a
	bitmask.
</p>

<p>
	To determine if an object should collide with another object, each objects
	group bitmask and the other object's mask bitmask are logically ANDed
	together. If the resulting value is not zero, the objects are allowed to
	collide.
</p>

<h4 id="raycast">
	Raycast
</h4>

<p>
	Useful for poking things, selecting objects. A raycast constructs a ray 
	between two points and check whether it intersects any rigidbody between
	these points. If an intersection is found, it is returned.
</p>

<h4 id="shapecast">
	Shapecast
</h4>

<p>
	Similar to raycast, but instead of a checking an intersection with an
	infinitely thin line, a shape is used. 
</p>

<h2>
	Collisions: how do they work?
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Like this.
</p>

	<i>This is how the bitmask ANDing works.</i>

<h2>
	Programming in C++
</h2>

<hr/>

	<code>#<span class="codekeyw">include</span> &lt;<span class="codelit">physics/physics.h</span>&gt;</code> <br/>
	<a href="../cppapi/namespacetram_1_1_physics.html">API documentation
	page</a>.
</p>

<code>

	<br/>
	<span class="codecomm">// main loop</span><br/>

	}<br/>
	<br/>
</code>

<p>
	Here's how we do raycasts. Let's do one from the render view.
</p>

<code>
	auto pos = Render::GetViewPositon();<br/>
	auto rot = Render::GetViewRotation();<br/>
	<br/>
	// convert rotation to normal vector<br/>
	vec3 dir = rot * DIRECTION_FORWARD;<br/>
	<br/>
	// set end point to ne 5 meters in<br/>
	// front of the view<br/>
	vec3 end = pos + dir * 5.0f;<br/>
	<br/>
	// collision mask -1 means all bits, aka<br/>
	// collide with all collision groups<br/>
	auto coll = Physics::Raycast(pos, end, -1);<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	// skip collision if no entity attached<br/>
	if (!coll.collider || !coll.collider->GetParent())<br/>
		return;<br/>
	<br/>
	auto entity = coll.collider->GetParent();<br/>
	<br/>
	// send a SELECTED message to the collided<br/>
	Message msg;<br/>
	<br/>
	msg.sender = 0;<br/>
	msg.receiver = entity->GetID();<br/>
	msg.type = Message::SELECTED;<br/>
	msg.data = nullptr;<br/>
	<br/>
	Message::Send(msg);
</code>

<p>
	This is how interactable object highlighting is usually done for a
	first-person view. We check if there is an object withing 5 meters right in
	front of the view, and if there is an object, we send the it a Selected
	message.
</p>

<p>
	Shapecasts work the same way, except that you also need to pass in the
	shape, which will be used for the collision.
</p>
