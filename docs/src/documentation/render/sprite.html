	Sprite
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	Sprites are like little images that live inside of other images. These
	images are the texture images of <a href="material.html">Materials</a>.
	Sprites reference materials.
</p>

<p>
	If you are creating a flipbook animation, it is easier to animate all of the
	frames inside of a single image texture file. But how would the framework
	know where exactly are each of the frames located in the image? It would
	know it because you created a sprite, which contains the positions of each
	frame inside the larger texture image.

<h2>
	What does is inside a frame
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	Offset X and Offset Y
</h4>

<p>
	Offsets in pixels, from the top-left corner. This is the pixel coordinate
	position of the top-left corner of the sprite and where it starts.
</p>

<h4>
	Width and Height
</h4>

<p>
	Width and height of the frame, in pixels.
</p>

<h4>
	Midpoint X and Midpoint Y
</h4>

<p>
	Offsets of the midpoint of the frame, in pixels. It is relative to the frame
	offset. Usually they will be set to half of the width and half of the
	height, so that the midpoint is in the midpoint of the sprite.
</p>

<h4>
	Border H and V
</h4>

<p>
	Horizontal and vertical borders around the sprite, in pixels. Only used for
	text rendering.
