	Animations
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	Animations are a <a href="../framework/resource.html">Resource</a> that can
	be used to, essentially, generate pose matrices. Those are used to deform
	meshes. See <a href="../components/animation.html">AnimationComponent</a>
	for examples of what you can do with animations.
</p>

<p>
	Animations consist of keyframes. Each keyframe has some data associated with
	it. This data is used to transform bones.
</p>

<p>
	Keyframes start from zero and increase at a rate of 24 frames per second.
	This is the same as the default animation frame rate in Blender.
</p>

<p>
	Animations can be created in the Blender program and then exported using the
	<a href="../plugin.html">Animation Exporter Plugin</a>.
</p>
