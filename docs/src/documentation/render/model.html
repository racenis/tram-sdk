<h1>
	Models
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	Currently we have three types of 3D models.
</p>

<p>
	All model types are stored in the <code>/data/models/</code> directory.
	Static models have the extension <code>.stmdl</code>, dynamic models have
	the <code>.dymdl</code> extension and modifcation models have the 
	<code>.mdmdl</code> extension.
</p>

	Static models
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Static models not only have normal texture coordinates, but they also have 
	lightmap coordinates. They can be lightmapped. That's pretty nice.
</p>

<h2 id="dynamic">
	Dynamic models
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Dynamic models also have texture coordinates, but no lightmap coordinates.
	Instead they have bone weights, which allow them to use pose matrices and
	be animated by animations and stuff.
</p>

<h2 id="modification">
	Modification models
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Unlike other model types, this model type has no vertex data of its own.
	Instead it references the vertex data of some other model. What is unique
	to it, is its material to material mapping. It can be used to swap out a
	material.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you have a pink teapot model which uses a material named
	<code>pink-pot</code> and you would like a cyan teapot model, instead of
	re-exporting another dynamic model but with just the materials replaced,
	you could create a modification model with the material mapping of
	<code>pink-pot => cyan-pot</code>.
