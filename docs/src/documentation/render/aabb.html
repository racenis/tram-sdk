<hr/>

<p>
	Whenever a 3D model is added to the scene by a
	<a href="../components/render.html">RenderComponent</a>, it is also added to
	the very large AABB tree which contains every model in the scene.
</p>

<p>
	This tree can be used to query the contents of the scene. This is useful for
	things like mouse picking of objects or decal projection.
</p>

<p>
	This system also contains the LightTree, which is an octree that contains
	all of the lights in the scene. It is used to determine which lights will be
	used to illuminate which objects, since it speeds up nearest point queries.
