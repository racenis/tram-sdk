	Audio
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	The audio system provides audio playback services.
</p>

<p>
	Currently it only supports playing back audio from audio files, and from
	.ogg format audio files in particular.
</p>

<p>
	In the future, the system will be enhanced to allow streaming audio, and
	possibly to allow for more formats to be used.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to easily play back sounds in your levels, check out the
	<a href="entities/sound.html">Sound</a> entity. It also has a scripting API
	option, which is useful for playing back sound effects.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to incorporate audio playback into the entities you are
	constructing, you will find the <a href="components/audio.html">Audio
	Component</a> useful.
</p>

<h2>Key concepts</h2>

<hr/>

<h4 id="sound">Sound</h4>

<p>
	A sound is a <a href="framework/resource.html">Resource</a>. It contains
	audio data loaded from an .ogg audio file.
</p>

<h4 id="source">Source</h4>

<p>
	A source will play back the audio contained in a Sound. It can be positioned
	in 3D space.
</p>

<h4 id="listener">Listener</h4>

<p>
	A listener is usually attached to the render view. It has a position and an
	orientation.
</p>
	
<p>
	It determines how the sources should sound like, relative to it, i.e. if a
	sound source is next to the listener, it will sound very loud, and if it is
	moved to be very far from the listener, it will be very quiet.

<h2>Backends</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Just like <a href="physics.html">Physics</a> and
	<a href="render.html">Render</a>, the Audio system provides an
	interface for swapping out the audio system backends. The possible
	options are:
</p>

<h4>OpenAL</h4>

<p>
	This is the default Audio backend. It uses the OpenAL library to play back
	audio.
</p>

<h4>Spatial</h4>

<p>
	An experimental audio backend. Uses path tracing adapted from the primary
	sample space metropolis light transport algorithm. Very fancy, but also
	very slow and broken. Might not even compile without some fixes.
</p>

<h4>Template</h4>

<p>
	The template for implementing further backends. Implements only stubs of the
	internal API functions. Can be used if you don't want to use any audio.
