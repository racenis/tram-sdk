	Entities
</h1>

<p>
	The framework comes with some pre-made enitites. These are very nice, you
	should try using them. If you want, you can extend them by subclassing them
	and building a new entity on top of them.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="entities/crate.html">Crate</a></li>
	<p>
		A crate is basically a
		<a href="components/render.html">RenderComponent</a> and a 
		<a href="components/physics.html">PhysicsComponent</a> glued together.
		It doesn't do anything special. Can be used for small clutter objects.
	</p>
	
	<li><a href="entities/decoration.html">Decoration</a></li>
	<p>
		Decorations are meant to display dynamic models. They can have a
		<a href="components/physics.html">PhysicsComponent</a> to be used as a
		collider, but it won't participate in the dynamics simulation.
	</p>	
	<p>
		They also have a<a href="components/render.html">RenderComponent</a> and
		an optional <a href="components/animation.html">AnimationComponent</a>.
	</p>
	<li><a href="entities/light.html">Light</a></li>
	<p>
		A wrapper around a <a href="components/light.html">LightComponent</a>.
		Can be used for real-time illumination of dynamic objects and for
		pre-computed lightmaps.
	</p>
	<li><a href="entities/marker.html">Marker</a></li>
	<p>
		A most basic entity. Has no components, doesn't do anything. It is only
		used for its transform. Can be used as a template to create further
		entity types on top of it.
	</p>
	<li><a href="entities/player.html">Player</a></li>
	<p>
		A very basic entity that serves as a wrapper for a
		<a href="components/player.html">PlayerComponent</a> and a 
		<a href="components/controller.html">ControllerComponent</a>, which are
		connected together. Useful if you want the user of your application to
		be able to walk around the scene.
	</p>
	<li><a href="entities/sound.html">Sound</a></li>
	<p>
		A wrapper around a <a href="components/audio.html">AudioComponent</a>.
		Can be used for environmental sounds, or if you just want to trigger a
		sound by a <a href="framework/signal.html">Signal</a>.
	</p>
	<li><a href="entities/staticwobj.html">Static World Object</a></li>
	<p>
		It's meant for creating worldspawns.
		<a href="components/render.html">RenderComponent</a> for the 3D model
		part and <a href="components/physics.html">PhysicsComponent</a> for the
		collision. Can add lightmaps.
	</p>
	<li><a href="entities/trigger.html">Trigger</a></li>
	<p>
		A wrapper for a <a href="components/trigger.html">TriggerComponent</a>.
		When triggered, outputs <a href="framework/signal.html">Signal</a>, so
		can be used for logics and stuff.
	</p>
</ul>
