<p>
	This is what is called a hierarchical animation blend space tree graph node
	automata. It basically lets you define how an
	<a href="../../components/animation.html">AnimationComponent</a> should
	switch between animations, and which animations it can and which ones it
	cannot play back at the same time.
</p>

<h2>
	Key concepts
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	State
</h4>

<p>
	When in a given state, the component will play back an animation. When the
	state is switched, it will perform the configured transition, such as a
	fade-in or fade-out. 
</p>

<h4>
	State space
</h4>

<p>
	The state space holds a They are organized hierarchically, and higher state spaces can override lower state spaces with their state.
</p>

<p> 
	For example, a character could have a state space for torso and for legs,
	both of which could be parented to a full body state space. It could then
	play back animations on the torso and legs seperately, but sometimes it is
	easier to create an animation for the armature together, like when climbing
	a ladder, so then a state could be changed in the full body space and it
	would override the animations of torso and legs.
</p>

<h4>
	Transition
</h4>

<p>
	When a transition between two states occurs, the animations have to be
	switched. A transition determines how this occurs. It allows to configure
	fade-ins, fade-outs and their durations.
