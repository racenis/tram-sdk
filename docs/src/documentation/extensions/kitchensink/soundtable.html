	SoundTable
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	A sound table contains many-to-many mappings from a key to a name of a
	sound. This allows to associate sounds with a certain category.
</p>

<p>
	For example, <a href="../kitchensink.html">Button</a> entity has a
	sound table parameter. When it opens or close, it will look up the sounds
	mapped to the <code>SOUND_OPEN</code> and <code>SOUND_CLOSE</code> keys 
	respectively. If it finds a sound that is mapped to a give key, it will play
	it back.
</p>

<p>
	Since there can be multiple sounds mapped to the same key, if there arises
	such a situation when a sound is being looked up and there are multiple 
	sounds associated with the given key, a random sound that is mapped to said
	key will be returned.

<p>
	Very simple API. It was supposed to be very simple, so it is such.

<code>
	SoundTable* table = SoundTable::Find("table");<br/>
	<br/>
	table->AddSound(SOUND_OPEN, "open1");<br/>
	table->AddSound(SOUND_OPEN, "open2");<br/>
	table->AddSound(SOUND_CLOSE, "close1");<br/>
	<br/>
	// this variable will be set to "close1"<br/>
	name_t sound = table->GetSound(SOUND_CLOSE);<br/>
	<br/>
	// this will play back either "open1" or "open2"<br/>
	table->Play(SOUND_OPEN);
</code>
