				<b>Audio</b>
			</center>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add an option to attach audio effects to audio sources.
		</td>
		<td>
			The OpenAL backend supports this. Other possible, future backends
			might also support this.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add an option to automatically determine audio effects for audio sources.
		</td>
		<td>
			This could be implemented as reverb zones, which are manually
			placed in levels, or the parameters of the effects could be 
			determined using raycasts, or with other means.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add an option to play back tracker files
		</td>
		<td>
			There are libraries which should be able to play back tracker
			files. One of them could be integrated into the audio system.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">
			<center>
				<b>Animation</b>
			</center>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add events to animations
		</td>
		<td>
			It should be possible to add a callback for a specific bone, and when
			a keyframe for that bone is reached, it would trigger the callback.
			This would allow syncing up code to animations.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">
			<center>
				<b>Language</b>
			</center>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add UTF-16 strings
		</td>
		<td>
			Currently it is possible to only use 256 different characters in
			text. By switching strings from char to wchar, we could use all
			of the characters. 
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">
			<center>
				<b>Graph</b>
			</center>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add Paths
		</td>
		<td>
			It would be neat if you could have entities follow a path that is
			laid down in the level editor.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add Navmeshes
		</td>
		<td>
			Navmeshes would allow better navigation by NPCs.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">
			<center>
				<b>Serialization</b>
			</center>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add serialization
		</td>
		<td>
			Serialization was yeeted out, but it should be very easy to put it
			back in. This would allow saving the state of the application.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">
			<center>
				<b>Files</b>
			</center>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add virtual file system
		</td>
		<td>
			This would allow files to be read not only from disk, but also
			archives. Files could also be written to archives. Files could
			also be read using HTTP GET and written as POST requests.
		</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">
			<center>
				<b>Rendering</b>
			</center>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Add sphere maps
		</td>
		<td>
			This would allow reflective surfaces. Would also need to add some
			way to automatically capture.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Light probes
		</td>
		<td>
			Implemented using spherical harmonics or something similar.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			 Detail textures
		</td>
		<td>
			would be neat
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Bump/normal mapping
		</td>
		<td>
			Mor edetails good!
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Planar reflections
		</td>
		<td>
			Using with stencils or something
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Transparency
		</td>
		<td>
			There already is, but it is not !! is not good! --> not blendered
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Decals
		</td>
		<td>
			Would allow projecting! images and that would be good.
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">
			<center>
				<b>Applets</b>
			</center>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Material Editor
		</td>
		<td>
			This would allow the creation of new materials interactively. It
			would also mean that you don't have to edit the material text files
			directly.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Model/Animation Viewer
		</td>
		<td>
			This applet would allow the previewing 3D models, as well as
			playing back animations on them. This would be useful for previewing
			3D models and animations. It could also be used as a 3D model
			picker/palette tool for other applications, or added as a default
			viewer program for .DYMDL and .STMDL files, so that they can be
			opened directly form the operating system's shell.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Modification Model Editor
		</td>
		<td>
			Currently modification models can only be created using a text
			editor. It would be easier to create them in an applet that can
			immediately display the newly created 3D model.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Language Editor
		</td>
		<td>
			Editing strings would be nicer if done in a GUI. It would also allow
			the comparison of strings in different languages and would allow
			detecting missing language strings easier.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Soundtable Editor
		</td>
		<td>
			It might be useful to have an editor for soundtables, which also has
			a sound preview functionality.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Animationtable Editor
		</td>
		<td>
			It would allow previewing of animation states in real time. Could be
			useful.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			Sprite Editor
		</td>
		<td>
			Would be better than using a text editor.
		</td>
	</tr>
