	What it is and what does it do?
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	Tramway Drifting and Dungeon Exploration Simulator Software Development Kit
	consists of approximately 30 000 lines of code. These lines of code have
	been written, so that you don't have to.
</p>

<p>
	The main goal of this project is to enable the creation of real-time 3D
	graphics applications. These applications could be video games, virtual
	reality spaces, various visualizations, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Most of the code of this project is contained in the Tramway SDK runtime.
	The runtime is implemented as a C++ library, which can be embedded into
	existing applications, or used as a standalone application, using the Lua
	API for scripting.
</p>

<p>
	In addition to the runtime, the project also consists of a graphical level
	editor, 3D content authoring plugins for the Blender 3D modeling 
	application, as well as various commandline utilities.
</p>

<p>
	In the future, the project will be enhanced by the addition of additional
	applications and utilities.
