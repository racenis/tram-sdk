	Adding 3D models
</h1>

<hr/>

<p>
	After becoming experts in the coloring of teapots, how about we replace the
	teapot model with something else?
</p>

<p>
	First of all, make sure that you have
	<a target="_blank" href="http://blender.org">Blender</a> either installed or
	downloaded. After that, install the <code>tram_dynamic_obj_export.py</code>
	plugin which can be found in the <code>/devtools/exporters</code> directory
	in the main Tramway SDK repository.
</p>

<p>
	If you have problems, or need a more detailed guide, take a look at the
	<a href="../documentation/blender.html">exporter plugin</a> documentation
	page.
</p>

<h2>
	Creating and exporting a monkey
</h2>

<hr/>

<h4>
	Step 1: Create the monkey
</h4>

<p>
	Look at the top bar. Locate the <i>Add</i> button. Then perform the
	<i>Add</i> &raquo; <i>Mesh</i> &raquo; <i>Monkey</i> selection. A monkey
	should appear in your Blender window.
</p>

<center>
	<a target="_blank" href="monkeyexport1.jpg">
		<img border="0" src="monkeyexport1.gif"/>
	</a><br/>
	<i>This is where you find the monkey button.</i>
</center>

<h4>
	Step 2: Give the monkey a new material
</h4>

<p>
	Next we need to give the monkey a material. Add a material in the selection
	on the right side of the screen.
</p>

<center>
	<img src="monkeyexport2.gif"/><br/>
	<i>This is where the new material button is.</i>
</center>

<p>
	Let's give the monkey the same material as the teapot. Rename the new
	material to <code>teapot</code>.
</p>

<center>
	<img src="monkeyexport3.gif"/><br/>
	<i>You can click on the name of the material to edit it.</i>
</center>

<h4>
	Step 3: Export!
</h4>

<p>
	Look at the top bar. Locate the <i>File</i> button. Then perform the
	<i>File</i> &raquo;<i>Export</i> &raquo; <i>Tram Dynamic Exporter</i> selection. A monkey
	should appear in your Blender window.
</p>

<center>
	<a target="_blank" href="monkeyexport4.jpg">
		<img border="0" src="monkeyexport4.gif"/>
	</a><br/>
	<i>This is where you find the exporters.</i>
</center>

<p>
	First, make sure that the monkey object is still selected. Now look at the
	top bar. Locate the <i>Add</i> button. Then perform the
	<i>Add</i> &raquo; <i>Mesh</i> &raquo; <i>Monkey</i> selection. A file
	dialog should appear.
</p>

<center>
	<a target="_blank" href="monkeyexport5.jpg">
		<img border="0" src="monkeyexport5.gif"/>
	</a><br/>
	<i>The big blue button. It does the export.</i>
</center>

<p>
	You will need to save the monkey to the <code>/data/models/</code>
	directory, so that the framework can find it. You don't have to name it
	<code>monkey.dymdl</code>, just remember to keep the file extension and to
	not put any spaces in the file name.
</p>

<h2>
	Replacing the teapot with a monkey
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Now we just need to swap out the teapot for the monkey. Change this line of
	code:
</p>

<code>
	<del>teapot:<span class="codefunc">SetModel</span>(<span class="codelit">"teapot"</span>)</del><br/>
	teapot:<span class="codefunc">SetModel</span>(<span class="codelit">"monkey"</span>)<br/>
	<br/>
</code>

<center>
	<img src="monkeyfail.gif"/><br/>
	<i>It appears that we are inside a monkey.</i>
</center>

<p>
	It appears that the default Blender monkey is much larger than our teapot.
	Let's resize the monkey, so that we can better appreciate it:
</p>

<code>
	teapot:<span class="codefunc">SetScale</span>(tram.math.<span class="codeclass">vec3</span>(<span class="codelit">0.5</span>, <span class="codelit">0.5</span>, <span class="codelit">0.5</span>))<br/>
	<br/>
</code>

<center>
	<img src="monkeyexplorer.gif"/><br/>
	<i>It is much easier to appreciate the monkey from the outside.</i><br/>
	<br/>
</center>

<h2>
	How to texture a teapot
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Going back into Blender, create another model. Maybe it will be another
	monkey, maybe you will use Blender's teapot generation capabilities, or
	perhaps you will create your own.
</p>

<p>
	Now comes the difficult part. Open up
	<a target="_blank" href="http://tuxpain.org">Tuxpaint</a> or some other
	image editing program and create a texture. It's best if you use an image
	size which is powers of two, i.e. 32x32, 128x128, 256x128, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Once it's done, save it in the <code>/data/textures/</code> directory. I 
	decided to name it <code>mybestwork.png</code>.
</p>

<center>
	<img src="creatingmybestwork.gif"/><br/>
	<i>I am very proud of how this turned out.</i>
</center>

<p>
	Back in Blender, create the material the same way we did before. This time,
	make sure that you give it the same name as you gave that texture image.
	Once you do that, in the same material pane you should see a <i>Base
	Color</i> selection. Click on that and select <i>Image Texture</i>. Now
	click on <i>Open</i> and find that image.
</p>

<p>
	The last thing left to do is to finish up the UVs. Enter edit mode by 
	pressing the <code>Tab</code> key. Select all of the model by pressing
	<code>Ctrl+A</code>. Click on the <i>UV</i> button in the top bar and then
	select <i>Sphere Projection</i> or some othertexture projection. Not use
	<code>Tab</code> to get back into object mode and perform the export as
	before.
</p>

<p>
	Change the init script to load the new 3D model.
