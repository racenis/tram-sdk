<h1>Adding Animations</h1>

<p>
	First, make sure that you have installed the
	<a href="../documentation/blender.html">Blender animation exporter
	plugin</a>. Next up, create a 3D model of something, create an armature for
	it and rig it.
</p>


<div class="infobox">

	<hr/>
	
	<p>
		Tramway SDK only allows 4 bones to influence a single vertex. Take this
		into account when vertex weight painting. If the exporter sees that a
		single vertex has weights for more than 4 bones, it will pick only 4 of
		the vertex groups that have the greatest weight for export.
	</p>
</div>

<p>
	For the animations, you will need to open the Blender's <i>Action
	Editor</i>. Each exported animation will be a single action.
</p>

<p>
	When creating an animation, make sure that each bone that will be animated
	has a keyframe at frame zero and another keyframe at the end of the
	animation, on whichever frame you decide to put it.
</p>

<div class="infobox">
	<h3>
		Note
	</h3>

	<hr/>
	
	<p>
		Use only <i>LocRotScale</i> keyframes, otherwise the exporter will
		explode and your computer will catch on fire. This might be fixed 
		sometime in the future.
	</p>
	
	<h3>
		Note
	</h3>

	<hr/>
	
	<p>
		Tramway SDK only uses linear interpolation, so make sure to set it in 
		your keyframes, so that you see the animation in Blender just like it
		will look like when rendered by the framework.
	</p>
	
	<h3>
		Note
	</h3>

	<hr/>
	
	<p>
		Since animations are resources with names, do not use a name with any
		spaces for your action name.
	</p>
</div>

<p>
	After the animation or animations are finished, select
	<i>File</i> &raquo; <i>Export</i> &raquo; <i>Tram Animation Exporter</i>
	option. In the file dialog, navigate to <code>/data/animations/</code>
	directory and click the <i>Export Tram Animation</i> button.
</p>

<p>
	Each Blender action will get saved into its own animation file.
