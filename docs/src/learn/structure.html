<h1>Structure of a project</h1>

<p>
	Your project files are located in your project directory. It also contains
	several other directories. This is how these are structured and where
	everything is located.
</p>

<h3>
	<code>/assets/</code>
</h3>

<p>
	Currently there are no tools which use this particular directory, but there
	will be in the future.
</p>

<p>
	The assets directory is meant to shadow the structure of the data directory,
	with the main difference that the data files are stored in an editable
	format. For example, the assets directory could contain
	<code>/assets/models/frogs/green.blend</code> file and it would have its
	counterpart <code>/data/models/frogs/green.dymdl</code> which is prepared
	from the first file.
</p>

<h3>
	<code>/data/</code>
</h3>

<p>
	This is the main data directory. It contains the directories for various
	resources, as well as language files, editor settings and entity definition
	files (might be moved in the future) and the material definition files.
</p>

<h4>
	<code>/data/animations/</code>
</h4>

<p>
	This directory contains the all of the
	<a href="../documentation/render/animation.html">Animation resources</a>.
</p>

<h4>
	<code>/data/audio/</code>
</h4>

<p>
	This directory contains the all of the
	<a href="../documentation/audio.html">Sound resources</a>.
</p>

<h4>
	<code>/data/models/</code>
</h4>

<p>
	This directory contains the all of the
	<a href="../documentation/render/model.html">3D model resources</a>.
</p>

<h4>
	<code>/data/navmesh/</code>
</h4>

<p>
	This directory contains the all of the
	<a href="../documentation/framework/navmesh.html">Navhmeshes</a>.
</p>

<h4>
	<code>/data/paths/</code>
</h4>

<p>
	This directory contains the all of the
	<a href="../documentation/framework/path.html">Paths</a>.
</p>

<h4>
	<code>/data/sprites/</code>
</h4>

<p>
	This directory contains the all of the
	<a href="../documentation/render/sprite.html">Sprite resources</a>.
</p>

<h4>
	<code>/data/textures/</code>
</h4>

	<a href="../documentation/render/material.html">Material resources</a>.
</p>

<h4>
	<code>/data/sprites/</code>
</h4>

<p>
	This directory contains the all of the
	<a href="../documentation/framework/worldcell.html">WorldCells</a>.
</p>

<h3>
	<code>/scripts/</code>
</h3>

<p>
	This directory contains all of the scripts. When the
	<a href="../documentation/framework/script.html">Script</a> system is
	initialized with a scripting language initialized, it will load the
	<code>api</code> file, which contains the language-specific script bindings.
</p>

<p>	
	For Lua, this is the <code>api.lua</code> file. You probably should avoid
	editing it, unless you know what you are doing.
</p>

<p>	
	There is also an <code>init</code> file. This is loaded by the template
	project after initializing all of the framework's systems. You can edit this
	file and put whatever you want in it.
</p>

<h3>
	<code>/shaders/</code>
</h3>

<p>	
	This directory contains all of the shaders for the 
	<a href="../documentation/render.html">rendering backends</a> that support
	shaders. You can edit them if you want.
</p>

<h3>
	<code>/src/</code>
</h3>

<p>	
	Contains all of the C++ source code for the project.
</p>

<h3>
	<code>/</code>
</h3>

<p>	
	The project root directory contains the executable file for the application,
	as well as various configuration files. This is also the working directory
	from which the various tools and utilities need to be launched from.
