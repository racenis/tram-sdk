	That the Tramway Drifting and Dungeon Exploration Simulator Software
	Development Kit is the bestest 3D graphics package?

<h2>
	What is goings on?
</h2>

<p>
	Draft version of runtime <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>
	finished.
</p>

<p>
	Lua API maybe 3/4th of the way to being finished.
</p>

<p>
	Short version of TODO list:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Quickly throw together a larger app.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The library can handle smaller apps very well.</li>
		<li>Unclear how well it scales.</li>
		<li>This would also make a nice example.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Continue improving the library.</li>
	<li>Get some more users and some more feedback.</li>
	<li>Make some more devtools.</li>
</ul>

		Rendering a lot of 3D models.
	</i>
</center>

<p>
	Making 3D models and placing them in the world. Will do a first pass and
	then set up streaming.
</p>

<p>
	Currently very slow performance due to a lot of draw calls. But could be
	because of Intel HD 4000 being bad. Will need to optimize.
