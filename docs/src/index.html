<i>
	That the Tramway Drifting and Dungeon Exploration Simulator Software
	Development Kit is the bestest 3D graphics package?

<h2>
	What is goings on?
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Version 0.1.1 is out. You can finally download an installer. Like a wizard
	installer. It will install the engine and all of the utilities. Very
	professional. 99% of other engines can't to that!
</p>

<p>
	The tools still are very glitchy and everything breaks all the time. But at
	least the engine is capable of shipping. Shipping real applications. You can
	actually do that now.

<ul>
	<li>Ship apps.</li>
	<li>Ship some more apps.</li>
	<li>Analyze deficiencies.</li>

<h2>
	Tramway SDK now ships applications
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Tramway SDK has now been used on actual, shipping applications. You can't
	say that about 99% of other graphics engines, since they don't ship. Like
	don't ship. Ever. Never will ship either.
</p>

<p>
	We have compiled a list of the shipped projects:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://kaimlatechnology.com/saas/">Greeting Cards</a></li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://kaimlatechnology.com/sea/">Undersea Simulation</a></li>

<h2>
	Why we use use sphere maps instead of cubemaps
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	<i>Big Engine</i> wants you to think that cubemaps are superior to sphere
	maps and that sphere mapping is obsolete. Nothing could be further from the
	truth.
</p>

<p>
	<i>They</i> keep insisting that sphere maps supposedly suffer from
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping">&laquo;image
	distortion&raquo;, &laquo;viewpoint	dependency&raquo; and
	&laquo;computational inefficiency&raquo;</a>. This is demonstrably false.
</p>

	<br/>
	<i>
		Where's the image distortion? It's a perfect reflection!
	</i>
</center>

<br/>

<p>
	Sphere maps might have been viewport dependent in the 1980s, but since at
	least 1998(!) there	have existed
	<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/285305.285310">techniques</a> that
	can overcome this limitation by using a single <code>if()</code> statement.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the standard approach to sampling a cubemap:
</p>

<code class="codeexample">
auto sample_cubemap = [=](vec3 nrm) {
	char* image = nullptr;
	float axis; vec2 uv;

	vec3 abs = glm::abs(nrm);

	bool x_positive = nrm.x > 0;
	bool y_positive = nrm.y > 0;
	bool z_positive = nrm.z > 0;

	if (z_positive
			&&abs.z >=abs.x && abs.z >= abs.y) {
		image = front;
		uv.x = nrm.x;
		uv.y = nrm.y;
		axis = abs.z;
	} else if (!x_positive
			&& abs.x >= abs.y && abs.x >= abs.z) {
		image = left;
		uv.x = nrm.z;
		uv.y = nrm.y;
		axis = abs.x;
	} else if (x_positiv
			&& abs.x >= abs.y && abs.x >= abs.z) {
		image = right;
		uv.x = -nrm.z;
		uv.y = nrm.y;
		axis = abs.x;
	} else if (!z_positive
			&& abs.z >= abs.x && abs.z >= abs.y) {
		image = back;
		uv.x = -nrm.x;
		uv.y = nrm.y;
		axis = abs.z;
	} else if (y_positive
			&& abs.y >= abs.x && abs.y >= abs.z) {
		image = top;
		uv.x = nrm.x;
		uv.y = -nrm.z;
		axis = abs.y;
	}  else if (!y_positive
			&& abs.y >= abs.x && abs.y >= abs.z) {
		image = bottom;
		uv.x = nrm.x;
		uv.y = nrm.z;
		axis = abs.y;
	}

	uv = 0.5f * (uv / axis + 1.0f);

	if (!image) {
		return std::tuple&lt;char,
							char,
							char&gt;{uv.y * 255.0f,
									0,
									uv.x * 255.0f};
	}

	return get_pixel(image, uv);
};
</code>

<p>
	Not only is it whole 47(!) lines of code, it contains 6 <code>if/else</code>
	statements. Remember that shaders can't execute those and only those
	<code>if/else</code> statements which evaluate to a <code>true</code> value.
	Instead they will always execute every single branch and will throw
	away the results of the <code>false</code> branches.
</p>

<p>
	Now consider our implementation of sphere map sampling code:
</p>

<code class="codeexample">
vec2 sphere_map_coords = vec2(normal.x * 0.25 + 0.25,
							normal.y * 0.5 + 0.5);
if (normal.z > 0.0) sphere_map_coords.x += 0.5;
</code>

<p>
	Only 2(!) lines of code with a single <code>if/else</code> that the compiler
	can optimize away to a single conditional move operation, resulting in
	essentially no branching.
</p>

<p>
	Now consider the fact that cubemaps consist of the 6 square sides of a cube.
	A lot of GPUs support only textures with sizes that are a power of two. If
	you put these 6 sides of a cube into a single texture, you will waste 25% of
	the space in the texture.
</p>

<p>
	Sphere maps leave only 21% of space empty. If you use a slightly different
	projection (paraboloid), you can reduce this number to 0%.
</p>

</center>

<p>
	Without a doubt, the push from <i>Big Engine</i> to use cubemaps is
	intentionally intended use up more RAM and GPU processing time to force
	users to purchase more expensive GPUs.
</p>
	
<p>
	We strongly encourage that you do not believe the lies and misinformation
	spread by <i>Big Engine</i> and instead do your own research.

<p>
	Making 3D models and placing them in the world. Will do a first pass and
	then set up streaming.
</p>

<p>
	Currently very slow performance due to a lot of draw calls. But could be
	because of Intel HD 4000 being bad. Will need to optimize.
