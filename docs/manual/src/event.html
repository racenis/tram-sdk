	Event
</h1>

<p>
	An event is a basic method of communication between entities and other entities or engine systems. For example, a player component can register a listener and when a player presses a keyboard key, a keypress event is generated and then forwarded into the component's event handler, which has implemented the behavior for moving the player.
