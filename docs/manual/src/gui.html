	GUI
</h1>

<p>
	GUI code is located in the <code>gui.h</code> file. It has a simple implementation of an immediate mode GUI.
</p>

<h3>
	Using
</h3>

<p>
	Somewhere in your main render/logic loop you need to put a <code>GUI::Begin()</code> call to start issuing GUI commands for that frame.
</p>

<p>
	After starting the GUI for that rendering frame, you can issue various layout and widget commands. There's <code>GUI::DebugMenu()</code> and <code>GUI::EscapeMenu()</code> commands for premade menus, but you can define your own. All of the widgets are in the <code>gui.h</code> file.
</p>

<p>
	After all of your commands call the <code>GUI::End()</code> to finish the GUI logic and submit the elements for rendering.
