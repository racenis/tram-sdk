<p>
	Player is a player avatar.
</p>

<p>
	It's a special entity, since it will crash the engine if an attempt is made at unloading it. This means that the Player entity should exist outside of all of the<a href="worldcell.html"> WorldCells</a>. The player-specific behavior is implemented in the <a href="playercomponent.html">PlayerComponent</a>.
