	Resource
</h1>

<p>
	A resource is a something that must be loaded from the disk, possibly asynchronously (it takes a long time to do disk reads), and might need to be processed after being loaded.
</p>

<p>
	The engine's core resources are the Model, Material, and the <a href="armature.html#animations">Animation</a>.
</p>

<h4>
	Adding additional resource types
</h4>

<p>
	Subclass the <code>Resource</code> class, definition of which can be found in the <code>core.h</code> header. Then implement the <code>LoadResourceFromDisk()</code> method. This method should set the resource's status to either <code>LOADED</code>, if the resource loading is finished, or <code>WAITING_FOR_READY</code> if it still needs processing (like uploading data to video memory). 
</p>

<p>
	If the status is set to <code>WAITING_FOR_READY</code>, then the resource's <code>LoadResourceFromMemory()</code> method will be called from the rendering thread, so it's safe to put OpenGL code in it. Before <code>return</code>ing, you should set the resource's status to <code>LOADED</code>.
</p>

<p>
	When the resource's status is set to <code>LOADED</code> during loading, the <a href="entitycomponent.html">EntityComponent</a> that requested the resource to be loaded will be notified of it.
</p>

<p>
	If you for some reason you can't load the resource (like a file missing), then set the resource's status to <code>LOADED</code> and the <code>load_fail</code> variable to <code>true</code>. Also you should probably set your resource to some kind of an error resource, or just crash the engine.
</p>

	<a id="resource-proxy">ResourceProxy</a>
</h3>

<p>
	ResourceProxy class is a wrapper around a resource pointer that helps with acquiring resources. Before its implementation you had to manually request a resource and then handle the waiting for it, and with multiple resources it became extremely cumbersome, so this class was created.
</p>

<h4>
	Usage
</h4>

<p>
	Add a <code>ResourceProxy</code> template instantiation of a resource type of your choosing to your <code>EntityComponent</code> class. Additionaly, add the ResourceProxy constructor to your EntityComponents constructor, passing this pointer into the ResourceProxy's constructor. 
</p>

<p>
	When you wish to request a resource, call the <code>SetResource()</code> method on the ResourceProxy. If the resource is not loaded, then when all of the resources that you have requested have been loaded, the <code>Start()</code> method of you EntityComponent will be called.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Note: </b>if all of the resources that you have requested have already been loaded, then the <code>Start()</code> method will not be called!
